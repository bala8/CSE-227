NOTE: this is a related issue to CVE-2006-4965 and the result of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-3670.
1175	CVE-2007-4879				2007-09-13	2010-12-27	5.0	None	Remote	Low	Not required	Partial	None	None	Mozilla Firefox before Firefox 2.0.0.13, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.9, can automatically install TLS client certificates with minimal user interaction, and automatically sends these certificates when requested, which makes it easier for remote web sites to track user activities across domains by requesting the TLS client certificates from other domains.
1176	CVE-2007-4841	20		Exec Code	2007-09-12	2011-09-21	9.3	Admin	Remote	Medium	Not required	Complete	Complete	Complete	Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.8, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.8, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a (1) mailto, (2) nntp, (3) news, or (4) snews URI with invalid "%" encoding, related to improper file type handling on Windows XP with Internet Explorer 7 installed, a variant of CVE-2007-3845.

1189	CVE-2007-3670	79		Exec Code XSS	2007-07-10	2017-07-28	4.3	None	Remote	Medium	Not required	None	Partial	None	Argument injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer, when running on systems with Firefox installed and certain URIs registered, allows remote attackers to conduct cross-browser scripting attacks and execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a (1) FirefoxURL or (2) FirefoxHTML URI, which are inserted into the command line that is created when invoking firefox.exe. NOTE: it has been debated as to whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or Firefox. As of 20070711, it is CVE's opinion that IE appears to be failing to properly delimit the URL argument when invoking Firefox, and this issue could arise with other protocol handlers in IE as well. However, Mozilla has stated that it will address the issue with a "defense in depth" fix that will "prevent IE from sending Firefox malicious data."
